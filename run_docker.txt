---------- Alternative with docker-compose --------------

You need the docker-compose.yaml file

docker-compose up -d
docker-compose run --service-ports singlecell-environment

When the work is finished, this command will stop your containers, 
but it also removes the stopped containers as well as any networks that were created.
The -v flag to remove all volumes too

docker-compose down -v
